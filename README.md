# TimeTrap
A simple chrome browser extension made in javascript that aims to help users reduce the amount of time they spend on addictive websites by making them aware of it and helping them set goals and timers.


This README is meant to tell ya'all that you make the changes in this branch, then send in push requests to me. I'll pull in your crap if I
think its good enough to go onto the extension.
